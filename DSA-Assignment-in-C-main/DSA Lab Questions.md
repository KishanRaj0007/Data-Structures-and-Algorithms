# DSA LAB QUESTIONS

## QUESTION 1

➢ Write a C program to evaluate the postfix expression using Stack. 

## QUESTION 2

➢ Write a C program that implements a deletion function for a binary tree. Allow users to delete nodes while maintaining the binary search tree structure. 

## QUESTION 3

➢ The contents of a stack S are as follows: 

```
Stack(S)  Index 
99        0      
20        1
4         2

          5
          6
```
            
o The Stack can store a maximum of seven elements and the top pointer currently 
points at index 3. Write a program to show the stack contents and indicate the position 
of the top pointer after each of the following stack operations:   
o Push (S, 5)    
o Push (S, 7)    
o Pop (S)    
o Pop (S)    
o Pop (S) 

## QUESTION 4

➢ You are given an unsorted array with both positive and negative elements. You have to find 
the smallest positive number missing from the array. Examples Input: {2, 3, 7, 6, 8, -1, -10, 
15}, Output: 1  

## QUESTION 5

➢ Given an array of integers, find the first repeating element in it. We need to find the element 
that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest. 

## QUESTION 6

➢ Write a C program to merge two sorted arrays in sorted form. 

## QUESTION 7
➢ Write a C program to insert a node at third place of the singly linked list and remove its last 
node. 

## QUESTION 8

➢ Write a C program that traverses a doubly linked list of positive & negative integers and 
deletes all nodes whose keys are negative. 

## QUESTION 9

➢ Write a C program to calculate the height of a binary tree. Ensure the program handles empty 
trees situation.

## QUESTION 10
